# Random Group Maker

## To use: 

1. Choose the class name.

2. Type in the students' names to add them to the database.

3. Press "Make groups" button to randomly form groups.

4. Press the arrow in the groups to go to their task card.

5. Type in the tasks to add missions.

6. Click the added tasks to line through or the minus sign to delete.

7. Press the "Start" button to randomly pick one student.

8. Press the "Reset" button to refresh the page to make new groups with the same students.

9. Press the "Refresh" button to clear the database to restart.
